- **User Authentication** â€” Register, log in, and log out securely.
- **Real-Time Messaging** â€” Powered by WebSockets using Flask-SocketIO.

## App Flow

1. Users register or log in.

2. After logging in, users are directed to the default lobby (index.html) that asks for Chatroom ID.

3. Messages are stored and broadcast live to everyone in the room.

4. If a message starts with `@bot`, it triggers a call to OpenAI and replies back with AI-generated content.
